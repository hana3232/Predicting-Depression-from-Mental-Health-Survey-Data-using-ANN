# 🧠 Predicting Depression from Mental Health Survey Data using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning-based model to predict the likelihood of depression in individuals using survey data. The model leverages demographic information, lifestyle choices, and medical history to make predictions. It is deployed as a Streamlit web application and hosted on AWS for real-time use.

Domain: Mental Health and Healthcare AI
Goal: To provide an AI-driven solution for early depression detection using deep learning.

🎯 Problem Statement

Early diagnosis of mental health conditions like depression can greatly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to:

Predict if an individual may experience depression based on various input features.

Develop a fair and unbiased deep learning model.

Provide an easy-to-use, real-time prediction interface through a web app.

💼 Business Use Cases

Healthcare Providers: Identify patients at risk of depression for early intervention.

Mental Health Clinics: Make data-driven treatment decisions.

Corporate Wellness Programs: Monitor and support employee mental health.

Government & NGOs: Allocate mental health resources to high-risk communities.

🧠 Skills Gained

Deep learning model development using PyTorch

Data preprocessing: handling missing data, encoding, normalization

Custom MLP architecture for classification

Building an interactive web app using Streamlit

AWS deployment using EC2/Elastic Beanstalk

Model evaluation using fairness and bias metrics

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Mental Health Survey Dataset (CSV/Excel)

Features Include: Age, gender, sleep patterns, physical activity, family history of mental illness, etc.

Target: Binary label indicating presence or absence of depression

Note: Dataset is anonymized and used solely for educational purposes.
